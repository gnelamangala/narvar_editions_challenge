# Starting up the app

Run the class `MainApplication` located at `editions-web/src/main/java/com/narvar/challenge/MainApplication.java` through your IDE of choice or execute the following to start up the web server.

Java 8 and Maven will be required to run the project.

```
cd ${root_directory_of_project}
mvn clean install
cd editions-web
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to view the full project instructions.

If you run into any issues with the web version of the instructions they are also included in the markdown file located at: `editions-web/static/instructions.md`.

Make sure to replace **this** README with your own customized readme as defined in the instructions file! :)

GOOD LUCK!
